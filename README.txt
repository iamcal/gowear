This pair of files allow you to pull data out from the bodymedia/gowear activity manager.

The JS files is a greasemonkey script, which will parse data from the page you're on and send it to the PHP script.

The PHP script can then make sense of the data and store it in a database or whatever.

The JS uses dojo as of bodymedia v3. It previously use prototype, when the activity manager did.

*** If you don't have a gowear fit, this is useless to you ***
